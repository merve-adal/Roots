# Roots
This game was made by me and my teammate Adem Han at the Global Game Jam 2023 event held simultaneously at Yıldız Technical University and all over the world. The theme of the event was determined as "Roots". We have adapted this subject to our game as the roots of humanity. Our main character represents any modern day person. The skin color is the same as that of a person living in Europe. The character starts running when the game starts. At the end of the episode, he reaches his previous ancestor. In the next level we see the character in the body of his ancestor. He finally reaches his black ancestor. The reason why his ancestor was black is that the first humans existed on the African continent. That's why the first human was used as black. Finally, our character enters the water and the game is over. This is because life began in water. Time has flown backwards for our character. As a result, our character tried to reach his roots without getting stuck.
